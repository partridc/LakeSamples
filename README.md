# LakeSamples
Subset of sequence data from Lake sediment samples for Molecular Ecology (Bio 485/585) 2021. 
These lakes include Brooks Lake, Hess Lake, and Pickerel Lake. Sediment was collected last summer. DNA from the sediment was extracted and we amplified the 16S rRNA v4 hypervariable region, which is roughly 253 bp. This is a common barcode region for amplicon sequencing when evaluating bacterial communities. We sequenced the samples using a 2 x 250 bp paired-end read format. So that means that each of the 253 bp sequences were sequenced in the forward direction, flipped, and then sequenced in the reverse direction. So, the data files for each lake should contain R1 files (read 1 files for the forward direction) and R2 files (read 2 files for the reverse direction). Note that these files are much smaller than the real samples. These have been subsampled to 10,000 reads per files; while the normal files contained between 60,000 â€“ 100,000 reads.
